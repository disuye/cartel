				<h2>Drivers, collectors, enthusiasts, investors.<p>We are Cartel.</h2>
				Cars are one of the few mechanical objects that elicit an almost primal emotional response. Countless words have been sacrificed to this topic suffice to say we know why you are here. 
				
				You love driving. You love cars. Throughout your life you probably have had many vehicles but perhaps lack the time, space & energy to treat them with the care they deserve.
				
				Cartel was established with one role in mind: To take complete care of your automotive assets – whether your desire is to maintain mint condition for future resale, or to hammer up a twisty mountain road every Sunday morning. 
				
				We provide the facilities and personnel.</div>    
				
				<h2>Power is nothing without control.<p>Complete climate control.</h2>
				Southern Portugal’s endless blue skies present near perfect driving weather, and some of the most favourable climatic conditions in Europe to ensure the preservation of iron and steel. However endless sunshine is no friend of paint, rubber, leather nor plastics and close proximity to the sea will wreak havoc on cars kept in typical residential garages. 
				
				To which – Cartel specced our secure storage facility with near perfect storage conditions: Perfect temperature, perfect humidity, perfect circulation, perfect air filtration, perfect ambient lighting, even the background music is perfect.
				
				Everything is monitored 24/7 with any deviation immediately flagged and addressed.</div>

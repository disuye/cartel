	<h1>About</h1>
	<div class="show-text">
		<p>Cartel is an enthusiast owned &amp; operated automotive space located in southern Portugal. We are passionate about driving and enjoy all cars, so Cartel was established as a member's club to provide various car-related services:</p>
			
		<ul style="display: none;"> 
			<li>Enthusiast Car Storage</li>
			<li>Maintenance &amp; Repair</li>  
			<li>Sourcing &amp; Trade Broker</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Enthusiast Car Storage</h3>

		<p>Our primary focus. An air-conditioned, humidity controlled, secure space with storage for ~40 vehicles. All memberships are bespoke: From a barebones storage agreement, to a complete 'Arrive & Drive' storage &amp; preparation schedule that includes interval detailing &amp; servicing.</p>

		<h5>How Does It Work?</h5>

		<p>Schedule a pick-up time, and the car will be ready to collect. Bring it back whenever you want, we quick detail the vehicle, inspect &amp; document any new damage (these are <em>driver's</em> cars after all!) and put it back into storage. Simple.</p>
		
		<h5>Where?</h5>

		<p>Southern Portugal in Central Algarve. You won't find our exact address online for obvious reasons. Some of the best driving roads in the Europe are right outside our front door (not to mention restaurants!). Our facility is ~30 mins from FAO international airport, and ~45 mins from Autódromo Internacional do Algarve.Centrally located for easy access, but isolated enough for privacy.</p>

		<h5>Anything Else?</h5>

		<p>Remote monitoring of member's cars is available; we can install &amp grant access to dedicated IP cameras, including online access to facility temperature, humidity and AQI logs, car's battery status and maintenance records etc. etc. All storage spaces are equipped with CTEK battery tenders plus a footlocker for members to keep a few small tools &amp; peripherals.</p>

		<h5>Caveats...</h5>

		<p>Please note: Due to the complexity of liability insurance, we do not allow owners to carry out work on their cars at our property. Apologies in advance. We would love to offer a community space, but  not at the present time.</p>
		
		<p>Also note: We presently do not offer flatbed transportation and delivery. We prefer car owners to source transportation services best suited to their individual needs. We hope to be able to provide transportation services in the future.</p>

		<h3>Maintenance &amp; Repair</h3>

		<p>Regarding our workshop, our main focus is 1980s / 1990s / 'young-timer' classic cars up to the early 2000s. But when it comes to servicing sports &amp; classic cars our garage is equipped to handle just about anything with a combustion engine &amp; wheels.</p>
		
		<h5>What We Do...</h5>

		<p>Our forté is mechanical &amp; electrical: Troubleshooting, repair, restoration, track-day &amp; tourist rally prep, period correct modifications, upgrades and general recommissioning. Factory spec using 100% OEM parts or 'just get it running for the weekend'... whatever the scope, Cartel is here to help enthusiast car owners keep their enthusiast cars on the road.</p>
		
		<ul> 
			<li>Interval servicing and pre-drive checks.</li>
			<li>Track day / tourist rally prep.</li>  
			<li>Refresh &amp; recommissioning.</li>
			<li>Replacing, upgrading or custom manufacturing parts.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>...What We Do Not!</h5>

		<p>Cartel Automotive is <u>not</u>, however, a full restoration shop. We can suggest trusted bodywork, rust repair, interior and paint partners – there are many workshops in Portugal already well established for nut &amp; bolt restoration – so we prefer to let experienced experts handle those types of projects.</p>

		<img src="/img/stills/s14b20post.jpg" class="show-two-image">
		
		<h5>Specialist Treatment</h5>

		<p>All marques catered for but our specific niche is E-series BMWs (if you want to get <i>really</i> specific then our niche is the E30 M3, E30 320is, E34 M5 – the S14 &amp; S38 powered cars – plus we're well into E36/E46 M3 and any flavour of Alpina / Hartge / AC Schnitzer). We've dabbled with various Porsches (944, 924, 928), Mercedes Benz (the 16V Cosworth 190E), Volkswagen (early GTIs all the way up to the mk7 R), BTCC era Volvo (850R / T5 / T5R), plus S1/S2 Lotus Elise and Exige.</p>
		
		<h3>Sourcing &amp; Trade Broker</h3>

		<p>Looking for something? Perhaps we can help. For a flat 2~5% fee of the final purchase price we can source, inspect, appraise, transact, import, and register cars for members – advising or handling every step of the process.</p>

		<p>Conversely, if you are looking to sell your beloved car, we can also digitise the history file, prepare text descriptions, photographs, video and assist with advertising on reputable online portals – and more importantly we can screen &amp; handle potential buyers (on the owner's behalf, if desired). As with sourcing, this service typically incurs a flat 2~5% fee of the final sale price.</p>

		<h3>Get in touch!</h3>

		<p>Thanks for reading this far! We can &amp; will chat cars all day long so feel free to <a href="#contact-show">drop us a line</a>, ask us anything, or just say hello.</p>

		<p>Too many cars? Not enough free time? No space? Cartel Automotive has got you sorted. TL;DR: We handle the chores, you do the fun stuff.</p>

		</ul>

		<p>TL;DR: We handle the chores, you do the fun stuff.</p>
		
		<h3 id="services-storage" class="services">Enthusiast Car Storage</h3>

		<p>Our primary focus. An air-conditioned, humidity controlled, secure space with storage for ~60 vehicles. All memberships are bespoke: From basic long-term car storage, to a complete 'Arrive & Drive' package consisting of storage &amp; scheduled servicing and concierge.</p>

		<h5>How Does It Work?</h5>

		<p>Schedule a pick-up time, and the car will be ready to collect. After your drive, bring the car back whenever you want! We quick detail the vehicle, inspect &amp; discuss issues to be addressed in the next service cycle (these are <em>driver's</em> cars after all!) and the vehicle is prepared for storage. Simple.</p>
		
		<h5>Where?</h5>

		<p>Southern Portugal in Central Algarve. You won't find our exact address online for obvious reasons. Some of the best driving roads in the Europe are right outside our front door (not to mention restaurants!). Our facility is ~30 mins from FAO international airport, and ~45 mins from Autódromo Internacional do Algarve. Centrally located for easy access, but isolated enough for privacy.</p>

		<h5>Anything Else?</h5>

		<p>Remote monitoring of member's cars is available; we can install &amp grant access to dedicated IP cameras, including online access to facility temperature, humidity and AQI logs, car's battery status and maintenance records etc. All storage bays are equipped with CTEK battery tenders plus a footlocker for members to keep a few small tools &amp; peripherals. Additional storage space (for hard-tops, spare wheels etc.) can be arranged.</p>

		<h5>Caveats...</h5>

		<p>Please note: Due to the complexity and cost of liability insurance, we do not allow owners to carry out any work on their cars at our property. This includes basic servicing or cleaning. Apologies in advance. We would love to offer a community workshop space, but not at the present time.</p>
		
		<p>Also note: We presently do not offer flatbed transportation and delivery. We prefer car owners to source transportation services best suited to their individual needs. We have yet to find a consistently reliable company. We hope to be able to provide transportation services in the future.</p>

		<h3 id="services-workshop" class="services">Maintenance &amp; Repair</h3>

		<p>Regarding our workshop, our personal scope includes mechanical and electrical servicing of sports &amp; classic cars from the 1980~2000 period. However, leveraging the combined mechanical experience of our members, our garage is equipped to handle just about anything with a combustion engine &amp; wheels.</p>

		<h5>What We Do...</h5>

		<p>Our forté is mechanical &amp; electrical: Troubleshooting, repair, restoration, track-day &amp; tourist rally prep, period correct (i.e: covert!) modifications, upgrades and general recommissioning. Factory spec rebuilds using 100% OEM parts or 'just get it running for the weekend'... whatever the scope, Cartel is here to help enthusiast car owners keep their enthusiast cars on the road.</p>
		
		<ul> 
			<li>Interval servicing and pre-drive checks.</li>
			<li>Track day / tourist rally prep.</li>  
			<li>Refresh &amp; recommissioning.</li>
			<li>Replacing, upgrading or custom manufacturing parts.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>...What We Do Not!</h5>

		<p>Cartel Automotive is <u>not</u>, however, a full restoration shop. We can suggest bodywork, rust repair, interior and paint partners – and there are many workshops in Portugal already well established for nut &amp; bolt restoration – so we prefer to let the experts handle those types of projects.</p>

		<img src="/img/stills/s14b20post.jpg" class="show-two-image">
		
		<h5>Specialist Treatment</h5>

		<p>All marques catered for but our <i>specific niche</i> is E-series BMWs (if you want to get <i>really</i> specific then our niche is the E30 M3, E30 320is, E34 M5 – the S14 &amp; S38 powered cars – plus we're well into E36/E46 M3 and any flavour of Alpina / Hartge / AC Schnitzer). We've dabbled with various Porsches (944, 924, 928), Mercedes Benz (the 16V Cosworth 190E), Volkswagen (early GTIs all the way up to the mk7 R), BTCC era Volvo (850R / T5 / T5R), plus S1/S2 Lotus Elise and Exige.</p>
		
		<h3  id="services-broker" class="services">Sourcing &amp; Trade Broker</h3>

		<p>Looking for something? Perhaps we can help. For a flat 2~5% fee of the final purchase price we can source, inspect, appraise, transact, import, and register cars for members – advising or handling every step of the process.</p>

		<p>Conversely, if you are looking to sell your beloved car, we can also digitise the history file, prepare text descriptions, photographs, video and assist with advertising on reputable online portals – and more importantly we can screen &amp; handle potential buyers (on the owner's behalf, if desired). As with sourcing, this service typically incurs a flat 2~5% fee of the final sale price.</p>

		<p style="display: none;">Have enough space, or planning to build a bigger garage at your residence? We also provide consulting services: Liaising with architects to help them understand the intricacies of car enthusiast garage construction.</p>
		
		<p style="display: none;">From task to photogenic lighting, flooring systems, sensor monitoring &amp; automation, air &amp; water purification, compressed air installation, properly spec'd accessibility from gate-to-garage (Algarve driveways are a sports car's nightmare), ramp &amp; 2-post lift installation, tool storage and more...</p>
